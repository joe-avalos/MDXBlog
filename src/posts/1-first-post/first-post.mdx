# Well, what do you expect, mother?

I'm afraid I just blue myself. Guy's a pro. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Really? Did nothing cancel? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?

## I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.

Army had half a day. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

1. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.
2. I'm a monster.
3. I've opened a door here that I regret.

As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked!

* Guy's a pro.
* There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Army had half a day. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'

Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Marry me. Steve Holt! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.

Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Well, what do you expect, mother? No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

I'm half machine. I'm a monster. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Whoa, this guy's straight? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?
