# You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

No, I'm Santa Claus! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Why did you bring us here? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

## Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Why would a robot need to drink? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

1. You can see how I lived before I met you.
2. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
3. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

### You lived before you met me?!

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? She also liked to shut up! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

* Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
* We don't have a brig.
* I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Anyone who laughs is a communist! File not found. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I can explain. It's very valuable. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I'm a thing.

In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Ask her how her day was. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

Say what? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. You don't know how to do any of those.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! No, she'll probably make me do it. Throw her in the brig. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Kif might!
